/* You are to write a program that creates two shared 
 * variables of type int. One integer is the BankAccount, 
 * another is Turn. Both BankAccount and Turn are initialized
 * to 0. Your program must create two processes, one parent 
 * process and one child process, and allow the parent to 
 * deposit (i.e. add) money to the BankAccount, and also 
 * allow the child process to withdraw (i.e. subtract) money
 * from the BankAccount using Tanenbaumâ€™s strict alternation
 * (see OS textbook Chap 4). Both the Parent and Child 
 * should loop 25 times and follow the rules below each time
 * through the loop
